# Git, Github, Python POO and Neural Nets

Small project where i aim to develop a simple neural network using Stochastic Gradient Descent and sigmoid as activation function, written python POO and versioning control with Git.

## Installation
Download and extract the modules.  ;)

## Usage
Use layer.py to create the network layers and neural_network.py to put them thogether using the add method, after the NN setup just call the train method and predict method.
