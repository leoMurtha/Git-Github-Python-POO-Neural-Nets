# Neural Network from Scratch

Small project where i aim to develop a simple neural network using Stochastic Gradient Descent and sigmoid as activation function, written python POO and versioning control with Git.

## Installation

Download and extract the modules.  ;)

## Usage

Use layer.py to create the network layers and neural_network.py to put them thogether using the add method, after the NN setup just call the train method and predict method.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## What i've Learned

With this project i learned version control principals and how to use Git and Github, also i learned how Neural Networks "learn" using Gradient Descent. I understood the difference between Stochastic Gradient Descent and Gradient Descent and how to calculate the backpropagation for a net. After a hard journey i am proud to say that now i fully understand the pillars for Neural Networks.
